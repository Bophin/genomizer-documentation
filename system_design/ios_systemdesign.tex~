System design for the Genomizer iOS application. The  system is designed using the model-view-controller principle. Each view is controlled by its own controller class.

\refer{fig:ios_UML} gives an overall image of the system design. Some classes are excluded from the figure due to making it easier to get an overall idea of the system. The controller classes of the table cells and some other controller classes are not illustrated in the diagram. The non-excluded are explained below:

\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{DataFileViewController}
Controlls the File view presented in \refer{fig:ios_files}. It contains a referens to an experiment and lists all its files in a table.

\subsubsection{SearchResultController}
Controller class for the Search Results view presented in  \refer{fig:ios_searchResult2}. It configures the table which holds the information about the experiments a search resulted in. An ExperimentDescriber is used to generate a description of the experiments.

\subsubsection{ExperimentDescriber}
Generates a description of an experiment using annotations chosen by the user.

\subsubsection{Experiment}
A class that contains all information related to an experiment.

\subsubsection{ExperimentFile}
Is a class that contains information about a file from an experiment.

\subsubsection{ExperimentParser}
A class that parses experiment information from a NSDictionary to an Experiment object.

\subsubsection{SearchViewController}
Controller class for the Search view, see \refer{fig:ios_search}. It checks which annotation-fields are used and tells the JSONBuilder to generate a corresponding search query when the user presses the search button. The class also contains a advanced search to allow the user to manually enter search queries. 

\subsubsection{Connection}
A class that sends and receives JSON objects to and from the server.

\subsubsection{JSONBuilder}
A class that can create diffrent JSON requests.

\subsubsection{Selected files}
The selected files controlls the selected files view shown in \refer{fig:ios_selectedFiles}. The selected files class contains information about files saved by the user. It has a method that can make convertion possible.
